The files in this folder will automatically run calculations and generate figures in Skarbek 2025, The Stability of Frictional Sliding on Dip-Slip and Finite-Length Faults, Geophys. J. Int.

Figure 1 is a vector cartoon, so there is no associated m-file.

Figure 2: F2_CriticalFaultLengthPlots.m

Figure 3: F3_FullSpacePlots.m. Data files StabilityData_Fig3.mat and StabilityData_Fig3_Edge.mat are also included, that can be used to generate this figure without re-running the simulations. See instructions in F3_FullSpacePlots.m.

Figures 4 and 5: F45_HalfSpaceStability.m. Data file StabilityData_Fig4.mat is also included, that can be used to generate this figure without re-running the simulations. See instructions in F45_HalfSpaceStability.m.

Figure 6: F6_LayerVS.m
